## Overview

Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is critical for deploying large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains such as clinical question answering (QA).  
In this work, we systematically benchmark uncertainty estimation methods across:

- **10 open-source LLMs** (general-purpose, biomedical, and reasoning models)  
- **11 clinical specialties** (both common and underrepresented)  
- **6 question types** (diagnosis, treatment, diagnostic test, definition, procedure/operation, other)  

We evaluate score-based methods, sampling-based consistency measures, and set-based conformal prediction, and we introduce a lightweight case study based on behavioral features from reasoning traces.
